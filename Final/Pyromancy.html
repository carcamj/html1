<section class="grid-container">
    <div style="grid-column: 1/span 3;">Pyromancies are simple spells that can be cast using a Pyromancy Flame and have no stat requirement. 
	A majority of them can be purchased from certain NPC's, but the rest can be found scattered around the different locations.<br>
	The effectiveness of Pyromancies can be increased by either upgrading your Pyromancy Flame or by using certain equipment.</div>
