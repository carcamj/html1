    <div style="grid-column: 1/span 3;">Miracles are Faith based spells that can be cast using a Talisman and a proper Faith stat. 
	Some of them can be purchased from certain NPC's, but the rest can be found scattered around the different locations.<br>
	The effectiveness of Miracles can be boosted by either increasing your Faith stat, using certain equipment, or by being near a Resonance Marker.</div>
