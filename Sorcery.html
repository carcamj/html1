    <div style="grid-column: 1/span 3;">Sorceries are Intelligence based spells that can be cast using a catalyst and a proper Intelligence stat. 
	A majority of them can be purchased from certain NPC's, but the rest can be found scattered around the different locations.<br>
	The effectiveness of Sorceries can be boosted by either increasing your Intelligence stat or by using certain equipment.</div>

    <div><p>Sorcery developed by Big Hat Logan: Homing soulmass. <br>

    <div><p>Can be found in Sen's Fortress.<br>Dropped from killing Griggs.</p></div>
    <div><p>Sorcery developed by a certain surreptitious sorceror at Vinheim Dragon School.<br> Masks all noises of caster.
			Effectively, Vinheim is controlled by the Dragon School, and it is no wonder that the town has its share of dark secrets.</p></div>
	
	<div><img src="images\Fall Control.png" alt="Fall Control" style="width:100px;height:100px;"><br>Fall Control</div>
    <div><p>Purchased from Griggs for 1,500 souls</p></div>

    <div><p>Purchased from Dusk for 2,000 souls</p></div>
    <div><p>Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile. Turns body nearly invisible. <br>

    <div><p>Purchased from Dusk for 3,000 souls</p></div>
    <div><p>Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile. Transform into something inconspicuous.<br>

    <div><p>Can be found in Blighttown</p></div>
    <div><p>Sorcery of the red-robed Yulva, one of the Sealers of New Londo.<br> Reduce bleeding and poison build-up, and undo various poisonous effects.
			One of the New Londo's unique healing sorceries. Perhaps she abandoned her Sealer duty to take her healing arts back to Blighttown.</p></div>
